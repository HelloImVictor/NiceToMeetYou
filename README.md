# NiceToMeetYou
Hi my name is victor and this repo is the source code of my website that is being currently hosted on GitHub Pages
its just a static site that was made using hugo and with a clone repository theme from a creator called rhazdon
its nothing much but just a personal project for me, feel free to check it out im going to do better about updating it but i am starting other projects now
i have my posts currently written out on paper and is waiting for me to post it on the site, which i will do soon just when im done learning ruby
PS i didnt remove the included base posts because of the fact its just filler and it keeps the website full even though it says its from 2014, those posts where created by rhazdon

Vibe check :)))))
