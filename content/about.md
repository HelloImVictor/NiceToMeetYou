## Introduction
Hi there! I'm Victor Mallo I currently reside in Florida and I am a computer engineering student at Valencia college in a transfer program into the University of Central Florida where I also am currently taking the Certified Cybersecurity Professional Course where I will have a total of 400 contact hours of labs, scenarios, and technical topics.
### Spsst!!
Since you're here why dont you check my <a href="https://helloimvictor.github.io/NiceToMeetYou/posts/">posts</a> out? I try to update with new random pieces of knowledge frequently.
## Accomplishments
So far, I currently hold two credentials from CompTIA, being Network+ and Security+. From not knowing much about cybersecurity and having a love for information technology I have a newly found appreciation for technology and how data confidentiality is kept and maintained.
## Things I'm Currently Working On (For Work and School)
I love to just randomly start things and work on them, so far I am currently:
* Gathering parts and components to repair and potentially 'jailbreak' my PS Vita I have owned since I was a kid.
* Building a "LacIntosh", a Frankenstein of a machine where it's 50% Dell, 25% Linux, and the real shocker... 25% macOS based. Why did I create this? just so it can satisfy my current vibe, sometimes im feeling like using a Mac or maybe a nicely installed copy of Ubuntu on a Dell machine.
* Trying to also figure out how to practice automation for use in my outlook. I receive so many different emails from canvas and id like to organize it without me doing the organizing. :))
* Finding other fun things to make.
## My Interests
You know, I a ppreciate the fact you are reading this and making it this far. My interests are:
* Of course everything about information security (I mean obviously, come on it's my career!). But genuinely ever since I started my leap into this field it has been an amazing knowledge filled journey where I find myself for the first time going out of my way to do things that aren't required but rather add on, for example, I never studied for exams before I always kind of took it and accepted my grade while I was in high school but now I find myself reading, watching videos, performing labs, creating servers, even being up to date in my knowledge in everything in this field. this career field I believe in more than a lot of other things, this field provided a sense of purpose for me and a challenge where I'm using not 1 or 2 approaches to things but rather 2000000+ angles, I couldn't say I had a true passion to other things besides computers but now I found where I fit. and I couldn't be happier.
* Anything about computers, and I mean that. I have a huge amount of love and interest for anything computers but unfortunately, it is also an expensive hobby, a way to combat this? go ahead and pursue a career in it. at least id be surrounded by it and it won't be mine to pay for.
* Anything about cars I'm also a huge car nerd and I love news about Tesla as well as Tesla-related updates. it's interesting to some people who know me because my dream car is a 2015 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution Final Edition.
* My girlfriend, Hi A!! <3
* I can also appreciate a good book, its important to have that disconnect once in a while whether you love technology or not there's nothing like feeling the imperfections in the pages when you're turning them. although I am weird about what books I read, I like to read a lot of technology-related books.
* I adore space, anything and everything, I also actively keep up with news from NASA, SpaceX, and even the ESA. I will buy anything with those brands on them.
It was all i can list at this time but dont worry, ill end up adding more things to this site and make it nice and polished!
### Things I'm Currently Playing,Reading, etc.
Well, this section is a little bit off-topic from a "professional setting" but it is a bit more personal to me. below will include the things or activities I'm currently working on now, like reading or studying... etc.
* Currently, I'm reading Mike Chapple's CompTIA CySA+ Study Exam book, published by Sybex I couldn't recommend studying material more (#notsponsored).
* Also, I'm currently playing Absolver Downfall, its a rather very polished combat-heavy souls-like game. It's pretty fun with its own very special art style which was the main stand-out point to me. I appreciate games that veer from the norm, where it doesn't go for the "EXTREME 4K RTX LIVE RAY TRACING REALISTIC GRAPHICS" vibe and instead of a direction towards a game with character through style. 
I also do really appreciate Game Informer magazines, definitely brings me back to pre 2016 gamestop visit vibes. (#also not sponsored)

Thank you for reading through this. I hope youre having a good day and I hope to hear from you whether youre a fan of the site or a potential employer who I'd be more than honored to be on their team.

P.S. I will post about best study material for CompTIA exams and certificates, with notes and genuine reviews since i actually do have some of those materials on hand.
