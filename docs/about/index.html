<p>Hi there! I&rsquo;m Victor Mallo I currently reside in Florida and I am a computer engineering student at Valencia college in a transfer program into the University of Central Florida where I also am currently taking the Certified Cybersecurity Professional Course where I will have a total of 400 contact hours of labs, scenarios, and technical topics.</p>
<h3 id="spsst">Spsst!!</h3>
<p>Since you&rsquo;re here why dont you check my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->posts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> out? I try to update with new random pieces of knowledge frequently.</p>
<h2 id="accomplishments">Accomplishments</h2>
<p>So far, I currently hold two credentials from CompTIA, being Network+ and Security+. From not knowing much about cybersecurity and having a love for information technology I have a newly found appreciation for technology and how data confidentiality is kept and maintained.</p>
<h2 id="things-im-currently-working-on-for-work-and-school">Things I&rsquo;m Currently Working On (For Work and School)</h2>
<p>I love to just randomly start things and work on them, so far I am currently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gathering parts and components to repair and potentially &lsquo;jailbreak&rsquo; my PS Vita I have owned since I was a kid.</li>
<li>Building a &ldquo;LacIntosh&rdquo;, a Frankenstein of a machine where it&rsquo;s 50% Dell, 25% Linux, and the real shocker&hellip; 25% macOS based. Why did I create this? just so it can satisfy my current vibe, sometimes im feeling like using a Mac or maybe a nicely installed copy of Ubuntu on a Dell machine.</li>
<li>Trying to also figure out how to practice automation for use in my outlook. I receive so many different emails from canvas and id like to organize it without me doing the organizing. :))</li>
<li>Finding other fun things to make.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-interests">My Interests</h2>
<p>You know, I a ppreciate the fact you are reading this and making it this far. My interests are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Of course everything about information security (I mean obviously, come on it&rsquo;s my career!). But genuinely ever since I started my leap into this field it has been an amazing knowledge filled journey where I find myself for the first time going out of my way to do things that aren&rsquo;t required but rather add on, for example, I never studied for exams before I always kind of took it and accepted my grade while I was in high school but now I find myself reading, watching videos, performing labs, creating servers, even being up to date in my knowledge in everything in this field. this career field I believe in more than a lot of other things, this field provided a sense of purpose for me and a challenge where I&rsquo;m using not 1 or 2 approaches to things but rather 2000000+ angles, I couldn&rsquo;t say I had a true passion to other things besides computers but now I found where I fit. and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier.</li>
<li>Anything about computers, and I mean that. I have a huge amount of love and interest for anything computers but unfortunately, it is also an expensive hobby, a way to combat this? go ahead and pursue a career in it. at least id be surrounded by it and it won&rsquo;t be mine to pay for.</li>
<li>Anything about cars I&rsquo;m also a huge car nerd and I love news about Tesla as well as Tesla-related updates. it&rsquo;s interesting to some people who know me because my dream car is a 2015 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution Final Edition.</li>
<li>My girlfriend, Hi A!! &lt;3</li>
<li>I can also appreciate a good book, its important to have that disconnect once in a while whether you love technology or not there&rsquo;s nothing like feeling the imperfections in the pages when you&rsquo;re turning them. although I am weird about what books I read, I like to read a lot of technology-related books.</li>
<li>I adore space, anything and everything, I also actively keep up with news from NASA, SpaceX, and even the ESA. I will buy anything with those brands on them.
It was all i can list at this time but dont worry, ill end up adding more things to this site and make it nice and polished!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="things-im-currently-playingreading-etc">Things I&rsquo;m Currently Playing,Reading, etc.</h3>
<p>Well, this section is a little bit off-topic from a &ldquo;professional setting&rdquo; but it is a bit more personal to me. below will include the things or activities I&rsquo;m currently working on now, like reading or studying&hellip; etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently, I&rsquo;m reading Mike Chapple&rsquo;s CompTIA CySA+ Study Exam book, published by Sybex I couldn&rsquo;t recommend studying material more (#notsponsored).</li>
<li>Also, I&rsquo;m currently playing Absolver Downfall, its a rather very polished combat-heavy souls-like game. It&rsquo;s pretty fun with its own very special art style which was the main stand-out point to me. I appreciate games that veer from the norm, where it doesn&rsquo;t go for the &ldquo;EXTREME 4K RTX LIVE RAY TRACING REALISTIC GRAPHICS&rdquo; vibe and instead of a direction towards a game with character through style. 
I also do really appreciate Game Informer magazines, definitely brings me back to pre 2016 gamestop visit vibes. (#also not sponsored)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for reading through this. I hope youre having a good day and I hope to hear from you whether youre a fan of the site or a potential employer who I&rsquo;d be more than honored to be on their team.</p>
<p>P.S. I will post about best study material for CompTIA exams and certificates, with notes and genuine reviews since i actually do have some of those materials on hand.</p>
